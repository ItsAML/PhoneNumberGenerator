# PhoneNumberGenerator

📎 Creating a complete number bank just by entering a 3-digit prefix :)

prerequisites:
openpyxl library
which you can install in cmd with the following command

pip install openpyxl

Attributes:

+ Simple use

+ Can be used in different places

+ xslx output

📌 How to use:

Open the script with your editor code, find the variable named threenum and enter the desired prefix without zero.

Click Run and then wait until the files are completely created for you.

After the files are created, transfer them to the phone and use the Contacts Tool program to convert and import them into phone contacts (the program does this automatically).

I have also prepared 4 complete packages for numbers 912, 918, 935, 936 :)
